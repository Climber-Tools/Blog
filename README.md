_Served using GitHub pages -- changes to `main` will trigger a rebuild action, commit with care (or use a different branch)!_


## Local Development

To develop the blog locally, make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Jekyll + Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed.
Once you do, you can install blog dependencies via
```
bundle install
```
and serve the website locally using
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --future --drafts
```
