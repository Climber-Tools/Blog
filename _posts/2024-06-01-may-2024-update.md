Hey!

We've got some exciting Climbuddy news!

As mentioned in the last update,

> Besides many improvements described in the [nerd stuff](#nerd-stuff) section below, we're a week or two away from finally launching a testing instance for Crimp, a climbing gym near Heidelberg, Germany -- the code that produces the models is in a relatively mature state, with most of the work being spent on UI/backend.

we did the classic _forget to multiply the estimate by two_ (there were many more things we wanted to pack into the first stable release), resulting in the instance being up **now** -- head over to

## Nerd Stuff

We've done some experiments with **[YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)** as an alternative segmentation network to Detectron2, and it looks like we will be using it instead.
It's much more 'batteries-included', which fits what we're trying to do more than having to fiddle with Detectron2 parameters.

We've also tuned parameters for determining objects of interest (that are later segmented).
We use adaptive thresholding (as described in [OpenCV's documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html)), reimplemented to work for meshes -- this works much better than global thresholding, since two different holds can be seen by a wildly different number of images.
