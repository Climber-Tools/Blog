July if you say that nothing happened this month!

Horrible jokes aside, this month's update contains some cool news both in the [**#App**](#app) department (mostly account stuff),
as well as the [**#Tech**](#tech) section (mostly sparse reconstruction stuff).

There are also things happening in the background which we can't talk about yet... stay tuned ðŸ‘€!


## App

Most of the non-account-related things have been implemented last month, with this month being spent on polishing the changes and implemented the account-related features, namely **password resetting** and **email verification**, both of which require an email service.
Luckily, there are relatively straightforward to implement, so a **`0.3` release early next month** is likely.

The exact set of features that will be implemented in the next version (modulo minor things) can still be found in the **[roadmap section](/roadmap#03)** of this page.


## #Tech

### Sparse reconstruction improvements

Until now, we have been cutting corners when doing sparse reconstruction on the new sets.
Most importantly, we have not been running [**bundle adjustment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_adjustment), which meant that the reconstruction precision was sub-par.

We have remedied this by using **bundle adjustment on the to-be-registered images,** which markedly improved the reconstruction quality.
Here, for example, is the difference in the raw number of points[^1] with and without using bundle adjustment.

  <figcaption>Number of reconstructed points for Crimp with/without <strong>bundle adjustment</strong>.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is only one of the many improvements we could make in the sparse reconstruction process, but arguably the most significant one.
Others include **filtering out false keypoints** from the original reconstruction and **splitting the reconstruction into sub-reconstructions** based on the matched keypoints.

### SAM more

We are also continuing ways of using SAM in our reconstruction pipeline, in more ways than data augmentation -- it turns out that it's really good at detecting all objects in the images, but just **doesn't really know what it's looking at**.

We believe that combining SAM with YOLO (classification/segmentation) in some way, along with a healthy dose of heuristics for holds/volumes, will produce the best results.
There are no benchmarks yet available, but we are looking into it!

[^1]: While the raw number of points is definitely not the only metric to look at, the median reprojection error is comparable with/without BA, so the reconstruction quality is much better -- more points means easier time for the dense reconstruction algorithms.
